2005-08-27 - Version 0.1n

* completely rewrote large parts of the hijacker:
  - use nice debugging macros
  - use ELF constructors for init
  - spew out less debug in normal operation
  - keep the devices that are not in use closed.
  - keep track of the supposed soundcard state. Complain if it is not
    settable.
  - changed the system() calls to run skype_bt_hijacker_onopen|onclose
    by default.
* added nice sample scripts for onopen|onclose
* included the btsco.diff to detect if the headset is there. Otherwise
  the aplay for ringing would hang the system.
* improved skype_pickup.py to deal with call numbers properly.

2005-08-24 - Version 0.1a
